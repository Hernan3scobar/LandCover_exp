    "Land cover classification is a crucial task for monitoring and managing land resources, especially for agricultural purposes. One of the most challenging but significant classifications is cropland identification, which can be vital for monitoring agricultural activities, food security, and land-use changes. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning algorithm to classify and identify croplands using Sentinel satellite imagery.\n",

    "Sentinel satellites, specifically those from the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 missions, provide a wealth of high-resolution data that is invaluable for land cover classification. Sentinel-2's multispectral imagery offers frequent revisit times and high spatial resolution, which makes it ideal for monitoring agricultural landscapes and detecting seasonal changes in croplands. This dataset includes information across multiple bands, such as the Red, Green, Blue, Near-Infrared, and Shortwave Infrared bands, which are particularly useful for distinguishing croplands from other land cover types."
